# Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository contains the code for the laboratory assignments and projects of the "Algorithms and Data Structures" course taken during the second semester of 2022. The code is written in C++ and aims to demonstrate various algorithms and data structures covered in the course.

## Prime Partition with Maximum Part

This project generates partitions of a given integer `n` using prime numbers as parts, where the largest part is equal to `k`. The partitions are represented as a sum of positive integers separated by '+'. The goal is to find all valid partitions meeting the specified criteria.

### Input
The input consists of several test cases. Each test case contains two space-separated integers: `n` and `k`.

### Output
For each test case, the program outputs the generated partitions separated by '+'. If there are no valid partitions meeting the criteria, no output is provided.
